# RoboticArmForSurveillance
Created an IoT-based robotic vehicle with a robotic arm attached on it that holds a web camera for surveillance. The construction of this project was done with border security in mind. For the vehicle's angular movement, I used servo motors, and for its linear motion, I used DC motors. A Raspberry Pi, which I programmed using the Python programming language, is mounted on the vehicle acting as the core of the system. As the vehicle goes around, the web cam scans the surroundings and instantly detects and recognizes the suspect. The motors come to a halt when the suspect is detected, and the camera records an image of the intruder. Ultimately, this image is then transferred to the cloud using Firebase, where it is further evaluated by a supervisor. If the supervisor decides to fire at the suspect, the robot can be commanded to do so.
